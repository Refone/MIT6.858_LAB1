if the strength of name is long enough, "strcat(pn, name)" can makes pn larger than 1024 bytes, potentially leading into a buffer overflow. pn stores the full path of the requring file(eg. "/home/httpd/lab/index.html")

	strcat(pn, name);

in dir_join. long enough dirname input can overwrite dst, which stores the full path of requiring file(eg. "/home/httpd/lab/index.html"). And there's no checking in function which invoke dir_join().

	strcpy(dst, dirname);

long enough buf can overwrites envp, buf is the method of request(eg. POST & GET), melicious user may input illegally.

	envp += sprintf(envp, "REQUEST_METHOD=%s", buf) + 1;

[http.c:112]
same as aboving reason.

	envp += sprintf(envp, "SERVER_PROTOCOL=%s", sp2) + 1;

[http.c:127]
unsafe use of sprintf.
	
	envp += sprintf(envp, "REQUEST_URI=%s", reqpath) + 1;

[http.c:127]
unsafe use of sprintf.

	envp += sprintf(envp, "SERVER_NAME=zoobar.org") + 1;
